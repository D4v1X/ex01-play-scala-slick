Directory content:
******************

In this directory there's a zip file containing 2 files:
 - create_table_tm_user.sql
 - dump_tm_user.sql

The first one is to create a simple table and the second one contains the data that has to be imported into that table.
For this exercise we assume Postgres as the database.


Problem:
********
We want to generate a little REST API with just 1 endpoint. This endpoint will be exposed in:
 - /api/data

The endpoint will return JSON objects with the format:
  {
  	id: user ID,
  	name : user name,
  	age: user age,
  	address : user address
  }

Feel free to use any technology/library to implement this.

This endpoint needs to deliver all the data in this table. The main goal is to deliver the data to the user as fast as possible.
